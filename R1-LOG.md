## [Log of Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode - 2018](#R2)


### Day 1 and 2: August 7 and August 8. Tuesday and Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I got back into the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. I have completed up through the Applied Accessibility section. Worked on this GitHub page and learned about linking within the page using this markup syntax

**Thoughts**: After re-commiting, I had second thoughts about how much time this was going to require. Once I started I was good to go again!! I am very glad I just sat down and started.

### Day 0: August 6. Monday
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to get back into the #100DaysOfCode challenge to keep me pushing and learning. 

**Thoughts**: I felt like I lost something when the round one challenge was over with and hopefully this recaptures that motivation!

### Day 99: May 12. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I returned to the land of the living and coding. I was knocked off my feet from allergies which turned to a full blown illness. This after being so close to finishing this 100 Days challenge. I'm only at about 85% so I reviewed the last 5 days of progress before I got hit, just as refresher. I updated my GitHub daily log for aboout 5 days of updates.

**Thoughts**: IT really is amazing how quickly the things you've learned can go out the window with a little bit of downtime. I realy need to apply these skills I hve picked up so they are not lost.

### Day 98: May 7. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I read up on and played around with CSS Animations on various CodePen accounts. Beautiful images and creations being made with pure code...Also, I am trying my hand at Chapter 9 Challenges in JavaScript For Kids book.

**Thoughts**: It is really awesome to see how they have taken CSS coding and made it into something created by an artist in the traditional sense. It makes me wonder if I'd prefer that style/type of coding versus the rigid JS, PHP, etc languages because of the output of the coding...the creativity. I guess I'll need to give it a try! I also missed the weekend due to the band meeting up for the Protest the Hero show in Toronto on Cinco de Mayo. Great show, great times!

### Day 97: May 4. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I researched palindromes for my next challenge in freeCodeCamp "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section. I also picked up O'ReillyMedia JavaScript Pocket Reference at Indigo

**Thoughts**: Each one of these challenges in the Basic Algorithm section are going to be a learning task each on their own! Looking forward to it and I hope I can find projects which incorporate these requirements.

### Day 96: May 3. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I took a different approach. I found new JavaScript questions on Stack Overflow and just worked on various ones to see if I culd solve the issue and/or just to learn about that code, which led to research/read! I installed new Visual Studio Code extensions after reading it!

**Thought**: I read a tweet today about a new developer wishing he had spent less time in tutorial world and more time learning real world problems. This is what made me think of going to Stack Overflow and seeing what I could do or learn.

### Day 95: May 2. Wednesday

**Today's Progres**: Today I completed one Free Code Camp Front End Developers Certification challenge in "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section. I also learned how to debug in Google Chrome Dev Tools from a Codeburst article

**Thoughts**: I got past another algorithm challenge, but it took some deep research and digging to resolve. Very hard. I didn't even know what factorialing a number meant...lol

### Day 94: May 1. Tuesday

**Today's Prgress**: Today I again went back to Free Code Camp Front End Developers Certification challenges & wrapped up "Object Oriented and Functional Programming" part of the course. I started "Basic Algorithm Scripting"!! I solved the first challenge pretty quickly...AND it included a function!

**Thoughts**: I was very proud of myself to solve the first one off the bat like that! Lessons, tutorials, reading, research is paying off...and really it should! The amount of time and energy spent on learning this can have a snowball effect!

### Day 93: April 30. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went back to the Free Code Camp Front End Developers Certification challenges to apply what I've learned so far. I got past the one I've been stuck on for a while and then went through a handful more! 

**Thouhts**: Little by little I am chipping away at the nemesis known as JavaScript! Ha!

### Day 92: April 29. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I listened to SyntaxFM podcast learning about 20 JavaScript Array and Object Methods by Wes Bos & Stolinski. Great episode and learned a lot!! I also spent some time playing around with Google Grasshopper app.

**Thoughts**: After listening to this episode, it dawned on me that even coders involved in the industry 24/7 still have areas that they need work and knowledge on! It makes you feel re-assured when you see these things...because you think they have it all down and every corner is totally visible to them.

### Day 91: April 28. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I met up with Free Code Camp Mississauga group Mississauga Central Library! Nice to talk to other devs and meet face to face and discuss programming and coding. I also updated my Daily Log on Github to cover the past seven days of the challenge.

**Thoughts**: 9 days left in this challenge!

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/990415673062055936)

### Day 90: April 27. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about the JavaScript Document Object Model(DOM) from the JavaScript  ForKids Chapter 9, Part 2 'Advanced JavaScript' section. Learned about insertng (mutating) text in HTML elements and jQuery -> Creating new elements, animating elements, chaining animations. Used the SlideUp-SlideDown, FadeIn-FadeOut, Show-Hide, animations and the properties for each, such as duration. I also used the 'append' jQuery method to add new elements to a web page.

**Thoughts**: It's funny that today's chapter covered the exact same topic I was researching yesterday on my own! Wow, 10 Days LEFT of this challenge!! This challenge has DEFINITELY pushed me to learn a lot about programming and coding.

### Day 89: April 26. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about JavaScript Output, mainly 'document.write' and 'document.getElementById()' with the innerHTML method. This led me trying to embed an external webpage into another page (iframe-like) using JavaScript. I just used the Mozilla MDN Dev pages to learn more about these topics to see what I could apply on my own. I also updated my WordPress template on my company site and required me to update outdated Font Awesome icons. I had to replace hundreds, so I cfound a Find and Replace plugin to make the job much faster!

**Thoughts**: Gonna step away from focusing on functions. It felt pretty good to play around with code just to see what I could do to a web page with HTML/CSS/JS.

### Day 88: April 25. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I spent many hours going over functions, looking thru Stack Overflow for examples/discussions. Went back to JavaScript For Kids challenges. I worked out a couple myself such as the Random Insult Generator, Adding/Multiplying two sets of numbers, and Comparing two Arrays to see if they re the same. Discovered the utmost importance of placement with return, as it needs to be within the brackets of the function. Trying  uot the new Grasshopper coding game by Area 120 (Google company).

**Thoughts**: I got a little further in my understanding of functions, but I still could not fully understand the functions required for refactoring the Hangman Game code using functions.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/989330802138894337)

### Day 87: April 24. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  I tried to finish off JavaScript For Kids Ch8: Functions() with the extra challenges at the end. I could not finish the challenges and left me very frustrated.

**Thoughts**: I just cannot get my head around functions. And functions are such a huge part of programming! I tweeted out my frustration and receive positive feedback and just shows the awesome support the #100DaysOfCode community is on Twitter.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/988889960735498241)

### Day 86: April 23. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started Chapter 8 in JavaScript For Kids book. This chapter covers Functions(). 

**Thoughts**: I took yesterday off to enjoy our first real Spring weather, re-energized! Today an 'Incell' nutjob drove his van down Yonge Street on sidewalks running down pedestrians. 10 killed, 16 injured. Suspect apprehended.

### April 22. Sunday

**OFF DAY**


### Day 85: April 21. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I watched multiple videos on GitHub tutorials and learned how to use Visual Studio Code to stage/commit/publish directly within the IDE! So simple!! 

**Thoughts**: Added another tool. Git knowledge within VS Code, lol.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/987913353212383232) - [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9cMWR-EGFuY)

### Day 84: April 20. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I finally got 'ftp-kr' to work with Visual Studio Code IDE! For some reason I was not able to get this plugin working, but now it is working exactly as described. I know it's not exactly coding, but it is a big help in my day to day coding...so I am counting it! I can now edit all hosted sites directly from VS Code...HUGE! It reminds me of DreamWeaver application, but better...much better.

**Thoughts**: I should really look at more into what other tools are available for VS Code. I am sure there are other plugins which would improve my workflow.

### Day 83: April 19. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did nothing but explore and absorb as much about JavaScript as possible. That's it, that's all!

**Thoughts**: JAVASCRIPT!

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/987134384410124288)

### Day 82: April 18. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Hangman Game and the additional challenges from JavaScript For Kids book, Chapter 7. I also expanded the game further with additional information and conditions, such as how many guesses you have remaining and if you get to two remaining guesses, it alerts you of this warning.

**Thoughts**: I have been spending so many hours and so much energy into JavaScript that I can tell it is paying off. I am truly proud of the progress I have made just over the last week in understanding this language.

### Day 81: April 17. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went over the last few days progress & updated this daily log. I started reading Eloquent JavaScript version 2. This book has amazing exercises! I cannot wait to finish JavaScript For Kids so I can start it!! Watched MaddeyTv - Day in the Life Of (developer at Pinterest).

**Thoughts**: Watching that video made me realize how that community in Silicon Valley really has it made and is really in a bubble all its own.

### Day 80: April 16. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I stretched the JavaScript For Kids challenge of #H4CK3RSP34K to a much further point. I created html, css, and js files to make a web page where you can interact with the converter! 

**Thoughts**: I feel great taking all the lessons I have learned and putting them together to make this webpage! I did have to google some of the code for refreshing the screen and how to have the output displayed into a new textarea, but any code I googled, I still had to work it out to customize it to my code!

### Day 77: April 12. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about website/app prototyping & some of the tools available such as AdobeXD. Ended up watching some vids on this topic. I also played around w/ a challenge in freeCodeCamp to see if I can solve it yet. Nope, not yet...I will, oh I will

**Thoughts**: I'd really like to get more of the FCC challenges completed so I can move on to my Front End certificate, but it looks like I have more crawling to do before I can run through that gamlet.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/984622267924647936)

### Day 76: April 11. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued JavaScript For Kids: Conditionals and Loops  such as - For, While, ++ Rehash. I also updated my Github Daily Log and installed Firefox Nightly build browser for web development and testing.

**Thoughts**: I have really enjoyed re-learning the same concepts and topics using this book. It really seems to drill down and use better examples than the other courses I have taken.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/984227106065436672)

### Day 75: April 10. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: In the 4th Quarter of this challenge! Today I continued JavaScript For Kids: HTML overview & Conditions If...Else. 

**Thoughts**: I find myself playing w/ more code in the console & trying out additional code to see if I can make it more complex and usually do! Wow! Feels mighty good...

### Day 73: April 8. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went back through all my notes and reviewed what I've learned since starting this challenge. I took my 8 Ball 'game' I learned yesterday to create a function of my own, using a button on a webpage to call the function with an alert!

**Thoughts**: So very happy that things are starting to 'slow' down for me when I look at code. Super proud of taking this challenge and pushing it further.

### Day 71: April 6. Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
ðŸ”¸Updated the multiple sites I manage with SSL's & updated all the links! So many non-https links, mainly images w/hard-coded links.
ðŸ”¸I also worked on our bands site (I know, it's a Wix account site but they do so many other features for us!)
ðŸ”¸No formal learning or courses to speak of today

**Thoughts**: While I was working on the band website using the Wix editor, I still found tools I have recently picked up which could be applied to design and concepts.

### Day 68: April 3. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Annnd you guessed it ---> Today I continued to read JavaScript For Kids and worked through code from the book. I want to work on JavaScript every day, until it feels natural. I worked through a statement where I needed to take a string with various capital and lowercase letters and make the sentence start with a capital and the rest in lowercase. I ended up figuring out how to do it myself, and even two different methods! I also have 'Eloquent Javascript' waiting to be picked up Mississauga library tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I feel like this book is really explaining things in JS where I am really starting to grasp it!

### Day 66: April 1. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued work on the YvM site and delved into JavaScript For Kids.

**Thoughts**: Not sure if we should build the whole site by hand when we have the Wix templates and structure already there. Maybe we don't need all the things we were looking to apply to the site re-design? Oh, HAPPY EASTER!

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on 'For Loops' on the Udemy JavaScript from Scratch course. #For #Break #Continue

**Thoughts**: F!@#

### Day 59: March 24. Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Objects assignment from Udemy JavaScript from Scratch course by Kalob Taulien and I watched JS videos on ProfileLookUps for a better understanding on freeCodeCamp certification course. Created a new JS Examples from courses I take pen on CodePen

**Thoughts**: I feel like some of the freeCodeCamp tutorials teach you like how to get four when you add 2+2, but then they give you a challenge for that tutorial that is like 'What is 2+2 then divided by 1, multiplied by 6, then subtract 2. I'm thinking "WTF???". This doesn't help me learn enough to get through a challenge!

### Day 58: March 23. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went through 10 units on the freeCodeCamp Front End Dev certification course. Watched a couple videos on JavaScript and re-created some JS how-to's from the W3 School in my CodePen account. 

**Thoughts**: Sooooo much yet to learn...

### Day 57: March 22. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Went through additional lessons on Udemy JavaScript from Scratch course then I found myself playing around in all these how-to's on W3 School site and feel like I should re-build each one!Seriously, pretty awesome tutorials for Front End Development. 

**Thoughts**: I think I'll make a CodePen for JavaScript examples

### Day 56: March 21. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the Two Part Solution for Project #3 on Udemy JavaScript course. Also listened to lesson on Imposter Syndrome, which is always an interesting topic. I finally spent some time to update the GitHub daily log! Also came across some awesome 'How-To's" on the W3 site, link below.

**Thoughts**: It's SPRING!!

### Day 55: March 20. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Project #3: #Modals from Udemy JavaScript Essentials from Scratch has been completed!  I also tweaked my portfolio site some more by adding my certificates. Created a new #id for the images. I also added the Modal project to CodePen and re-organized my pens.

**Thoughts**: This was a very effective way to see how the big three work together HTML CSS JS (thanks to the w3 Modal examples). I need to start doing projects like this and add to my CodePen page!

### Day 54: March 19. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I tweaked my portfolio site and completed another couple modules on the Udemy JavaScript Essentials from Scratch course focusing on Try, Catch, Throw and Finally as well as Scopes. I'm now at Project #3: Modals

**Thoughts**: Are tese Try Catch Throw error logs really used? I have seen no other course talk about these topics. I'm sure they are used, but wide-spread?

### Day 53: March 18. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I updated my GitHub daily log and spruced it up. Created and added a header and learned how to display images in my log. I listene to a couple freCodeCamp podcasts

**Thoughts**: Chill day...

### Day 52: March 17. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  I went through modules 27 through 30 on the Udemy JavaScript from Scratch course by Kalob Taulien, which provided a lot of insight on Anonymous Functions, 'this' and Hoisting. I wrote two practice 'Anonymous Functions', but was not able to run one of them. The 'Name' anon function wouldn't work properly, but my number anon function worked as expected. They appear to be corect with the same data flow...

**Thoughts**: I'd really like some projects to work on with these tools so I can keep applying what I have learned so fr. Maybe I can look at the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/975125499985956864)

### Day 51: March 16. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the JavaScript Tutorial course on Solo Learn and received my certificate. Great JS course and would highly recommend taking it for fundamentals. It showed me things no other course touched on and taught the other fundamentals in a different approach. I am going to finish the other open JS courses I was working on (the Udemy JavaSctipt from Scratch course), but may start the php course on Solo Learn as well.

**Thoughts**: I guess all of these different courses are working because little by little I am starting to learn JavaScript and feel like I 'can' learn it.

### Day 50: March 15. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 50% of the way through this #100Days challenge. I completed the CSS course on Solo Learn today and earned my certificate! I've moved on to the first few Modules in the JavaScript course

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get back into it and get another course completed and under my belt.

### Day 49: March 14. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent today going through additional lessons on the CSS course on Solo Learn. I am about half way through this course.

**Thoughts**: None today, just pushing through...

### Day 48: March 13. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Back from vacation and back to it! Spent today getting back up to speed and in the groove by going through additional lessons on the CSS course on Solo Learn.

**Thoughts**: Even though I am learning all of this, I am wondering how I will apply it and retain it if I am not working in the field day in and day out...

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/973667095862005760)

### March 4th through March 12th. OFF due to being on vacation.

### Day 47: March 3. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Solo Learn HTML course and received my certificte! I even started the CSS course and should be done with that soon. I went through the Project #2 - Calculator solution for the JavaScript from Scratch course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: I really think I need to edit and customize already established and written JavaScript code to better understand it. It is how I learned HTML and CSS. Customizing pieces of code that fit to what I needed it to do. Maybe that is the answer to understand JavaScript. I am taking a break as we are going on vacation to Disney World.

### Day 46: March 2. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through additional The Complete Course: 2018 JavaScript Essentials From Scratch lessons, mainly focused on Functions and Events. I will be starting the Calculator project (#2) tomorrow. I signed up for Solo Learn and started the HTML course. Going through these pretty quickly.

**Thoughts**: I think I get JavaScript and then in the same breath I don't think I'll ever understand JavaScript.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/969728719018446850)

### Day 45: March 1. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through additional The Complete Course: 2018 JavaScript Essentials From Scratch lessons, mainly about Query Selectors. I created my own sample page and js as well. I also read a great article today about CSS artwork. It got me really really excited to delve into that after these other courses are completed. Looks like fun!

**Thoughts**: Don't give up. That is the mantra I hear over and over again from people learning and those that support new coders or coders in general. So, I am not giving up!

### Day 44: February 28. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent today showing how Chris can use Wix for our band website. Not much coding going on there, but still a lot of elements to consider and navigating through questions and solutions.

**Thoughts**: I have heard that coding jobs inolve so much more than just coding. Today wa a good example, I believe, of the different things you have to juggle and understand to be a well rounded front-end developer.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/969034234190065664)

### OFF DAY: February 27. Tuesday

**Reason**: Jammed Day with work and then out the dor for rehearsal after a quick bite for dinner. Home late at midnight.

### Day 43: February 26. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the JavaScript from Scratch course and learned about operators and if/else statements. I got my console up and working in my Atom IDE so I don't have to keep switching between browser and editor.


**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if Ill ever take coding into a job situation or career, but I am having fun learning these languages. Today marks the start of Week Seven in this awesome coding challenge!

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/968315957184794626)

### Day 42: February 25. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started and completed Project 1 from the JavaScript Course. This was a project where you needed to end up making a URL friendly address using strings and methods. I worked on it in the console and Atom until it worked. Then I watched the solution on how Kalob would have done it. He added a step I didn't add and I added additional steps he hadn't added, but in the end they were both correct. It feels really good when you work it out on your own!

**Thoughts**: Many times your cose or project will not end up being an exact replica of the person teaching or your colleague. It will have your own take, but you can always learn from how they approached it and apply it to your knowledge base.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/967933793716854784)

### Day 41: February 24. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I continued the JavaScript from Scratch course. Played around in the console for a long time to see how things work. Tomorrow I start on Project 1 of 3 for this course

**Thoughts**: Just spending a little bit of time coding is really helpful and re-connects the things that I have been learning.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/967598150482526210)

### Day 40: February 23. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I feel like I really need to learn more JavaScript before I go back to the Front End Developers Certificate on freeCodeCamp. So, I started Kalob Tauliens fullblown JS course for free since he provided a free link after I finished the 'mini-course'. The Complete Course: 2018 JavaScript Essentials From Scratch is what it is called.

**Thoughts**: Not much in-depth today. I do like it when I find the zone and end up coding or learning for hours.

### DAY OFF: February 22. Thursday

**PERSONAL DAY**

### Day 39: February 21. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Well, today I got a lot settled! I realized I needed to separate my form area in a new div. Created the CSS and html for that. 3 column form with all labels/inputs centered. Found an easy to use HTML to email php code I could use on the form. I created Thank you and Error pages for the php form functions to work properly. Test and everything is working as intended! The only concern now is media size on Chrome browser. I am getting overflow pushing the form into everything. I tested on Firefox and everything seems to minimize properly. I need to look into further.

**Thought**: I was really doubting whether or not I had the umph to continue down this road, but every time I ever seem to have any doubts, I get a kick in the pants and seem to pick up steam. I must have spent 4 hours or more cosing today. Really applying things I have learned and finding my own way to code and complete the tasks. Feels good! I do need to get httpS for my site.

### Day 38: February 20. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked and worked at trying to get forms down and in place on my footer last night. This is where all the other contact info to social liks is, so I wanted to work it into that area. Frustrating. I worked with forms and CSS and tried so many variations to see what would break and how it would be affected by changing this or that. I was even looking at other people's CSS Grid forms and considered using them. Shame.

**Thoughts**: I'll have to try again fresh tomorrow and see if I can find a way to make forms and grid work properly with how I have my site currently laid out.

### Day 37: February 19. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien passed with flying colors, but never received any certificate? Maybe it is sent via email? I left a comment on the discussion area on ArkMont. 

**Thoughts**: Not sure where to go next. I was thinking back to freeCodeCamp Dev Certification course, but I feel like I need some more hands on work and practice. Then I would like more practice on JavaScript.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/965770848073338881)

### Day 36: February 18. Sunday

**Tody's Progress**: Almost thru Module 2: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien but went down the rabbit hole on Forms & how they work with CSS Grid layout. Worked on forms for 2 hrs+. I applied a bunch of different scenarios to my Portfolio page, but have not found the right one. I think tomorrow I'll sit down and come up with my own code.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait to put myself out there to see what I can come up with and where I can help. I think I want to reach out to charity or social work orgs that may need any type of help with front end dev or marketing, etc...

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/965411278410993665)

### Day 35: February 17. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Halfway thru Module 2: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien, hoping to finish that off tomorrow. Listened to my first Learn To Code With Me podcast E1S1, very good interview and discussion!

**Thoughts**: The poscast had a lot of interesting similarities with me. I basically trained myself html and CSS and got into eCommerce sites and Payment, Shipping and marketing areas...then felt like I didn't deserve or live up to being considered a 'programmer' or 'coder' so I moved back into familiar grounds like customer service and sales. There is no cert or badge you get which states "YOU ARE NOW A PROGRAMMER"...so build, code, test, try, put yourself out there and see what comes of it!!!

### Day 34: February 16. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 1: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien Nice to go over current standards & uses after a long coding layoff.

**Thoughts**: You never know what you may miss when you've taken a course on a particular subject before. Plus, as you mature you can understand thisngs completely from a different viewpoint.

### Day 33: February 15. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Wes Bos CSS Grid Masters Course. This was a really good course and the teaching was excellent. I applied many tips to my portfolio site and now my nav flows properly. I was just using hard column numbers instead of incorporating 'span' into the length of nav item.   

**Thoughts**: Going to tackle the Arkmont course: "The Ultimate HTML Developer - Learn proper HTML from scratch." Feels good to resolidify the basics after being away from coding for so long.

### Day 32: February 14. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went thru additional parts in the Wes Bos CSS Grid Masters course and applied some of the techniques he showed to my own site to play around with concepts. Looking to finish this tutorial Thursday.  

**Thoughts**: Wes Bos makes programming look like just conversation when watching his videos. It is like he has this "fluent programming" language that has a really nice accent!

### Day 31: February 13. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Went through additional parts in the Wes Bos CSS Grid Masters course. 

**Thoughts**: Really loving CSS Grid and I seem to keep coming back to it. I used to be so frustrated by floats and z-index and negative margins, absolutes..., so may other layout issues with CSS. I actually find CSS Grid layout FUN!

### Day 30: February 12. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Checked out some podcasts on the freeCodeCamp site. Some were okay, different views on coding and learning.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy hopping back and forth between different subjects - i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hopefully it won't lead to confusion the deeper I get, but so far so good. They seem to work well together and also just stripped down on their own.

### Day 29: February 11. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JavaScript Essentials 2018 Mini Course on Udemy and signed up for two other free courses. One being a Full Stack Web Developer Course and the other a free Ultimate HTML Developer Course. Got through another few challenges on the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification course.

**Thoughts**: I realized I have been writing this daily log backwards. I should be updating at the top. I'll re-arrange one of these days but today was the day to start, lol.

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through Lessons 13-37 on the #freeCodeCamp front end certification challenge

**Thoughts:** Let's code! It feels really good to remember a lot of what I used to do on a regular basis!

**Link to work:** Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/952290151279091712

### Day 2: January 14. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'HTML5 and CSS' #refresher in the Front End Development Certification course!

**Thoughts**: CCS and HTML have not changed much since the last time I was programming a few years back. Coming back to me...

**Link to work**: Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/952585101103239173

### Day 3: January 15. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Over halfway through that...tomorrow finish the segment starting at 'Create a Bootstrap Headline'

**Thoughts**: Worked with Bootstrap in later Wordpress templates and it kind of intimidated me back then. Now, not so much as I am learning the ins and outs of it. I did work with FontAwesome on previous sites, but the syntax in the courses have expanded that use for sure.

**Link to work**: Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/953100248884359174

### Day 4: January 16. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Started the jQuery course

**Thoughts**: Stay the course

**Link to work**: Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/953401646809219072

### Day 5: January 17. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub, watched tutorials and read articles related to the use of GitHub. Installed on my Linux and working with CLI to clone reps, update files, get status, add files, learn to comment my commits ( -m ) 
Set up my daily log for my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Completed the 'jQuery' in the Front End Development Certification course!

**Thoughts**: Gotta crawl before you walk

**Link to work**: I used the following to learn more about GitHub:

### Day 6: January 18. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. Committed to only using Bootstrap. I am using getbootstrap.com resources like crazy just learning all the rules and syntax.

**Thoughts**: I need to see what other sites are available for Bootstrap tips and tricks. Currently learning version 4.

### Day 7: January 19. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. My tribute was to the late great Lemmy Kilmister 

**Thoughts**: Noticed some bootstrap elements are not 'all-browser' compliant...ugg. Looks differently in Firefox than Chrome, for example.

### Day 8: January 20. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded my Tribute Page code/file to GitHub repo. Reviewed the next project requirements for the Portfolio' project and started with initial design layout ideas. Started reading 'Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6' as I want to sign up for the Coursera UofT's 'Learn to Program: The Fundamentals' course.

**Thoughts**: Don't take on too much too soon and get burnt out! Don't a breath and approach each day as its own, not worrying about what you still need to accomplish!

### Day 9: January 21. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1st part of 'Learn CSS Grid' on Scrimba as I want to incorporate this into my portfolio project instead of bootstrap. It's compliant across all browsers and appears to be less code and fuss.

**Thoughts**: So many ways you can use new libraries and techniques to create layouts for front end development!

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/955153254165504000

### Day 10: January 22. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. I learned more about using CSS Grid fixed positions so I can incorporate it into my portfilio project. I need the navigation to stay fixed on the screen while scrolling. This means this 'container' needs to be in it's own grid or else you'll break the rest of the grid where content and footer would be. I also updated the Wordpress version on company site and registered additional domains.

**Thoughts**: Goal is to have Portfolio Project completed by end of week, using as much CSS Grid as possible.

### Day 11: January 23. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied, read, practiced more CSS Grid articles, documentation, examples and blogs. Started practicing on the Portfolio Project. Installed 'Brackets' IDE.

**Thoughts**: I'd really like to maybe specialize or focus on CSS Design and Coding

### Day 12: January 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't feel like much progress was made. In fact, I felt like an idiot throughout the day trying to code my Portfolio Project. I have been trying to use CSS Grid and HTML, no other libraries or tools. I just hit a brick wall. I ended up reading about 4 hours of documentation related to CSS, HTML, Grid, Flex, you name it!

**Thoughts**: There is SOOOOOOO much to learn and apply yet.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/956366303849340929

### Day 13: January 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Although I hit a brick wall yesterday, I have pushed through and light has dawned on the areas I was having trouble getting my head around. I ended up getting my Portfolio Project 99.9% completed. I just need to tweak here or there for cosmetic/perfectionist ways. Uploaded a copy of the Portfolio Project code to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: Remember to push and read and try...so the next day or so the answer is visible.

### Day 14: January 26. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweaked my Portfolio Project a little bit. Started the 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through about 25 units. 

**Thoughts**: Python and JavaScript were the top two most sought skills going into 2018. I bet CSS Grid is up there too as it becomes more adopted across all browsers and devices. Looking forward to starting my Coursera course on Python!

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/957084911751630849

### Day 15: January 27. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Upgrading my WordPress sites to PHP v7...which is a pain because of the mySQL to mySQLi injection. I may choose to forward two of the URL's as they are no longer needed/active. Pick my battles on which to update/upgrade. Thinking of buying davidqpyle.io as my 'tech' portfolio page. Continued 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through another 15 units.

**Thought**: Loving all the support and reading articles/blogs from other 100DaysOfCode challengers. Really does give you hope that all this learing from various parts of the internet will add up to something bigger one day lol

### Day 16: January 28. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished upgrading my WordPress sites to a supported PHP version...pulled the trigger and now any and all sites are officially on v7. Not much else besides reading and absorbing. 

**Thought**:

### Day 17: January 29. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through 8 units... Arrays Functions Parameters Arguments were confusing at first (well, arrays, sub-arrays and multi-dimensional arrays).

**Thoughts**: Even though you may not want to sit down and code, you'll find that you are quickly absorbed into what you are learning or accomplishing that you forget you never wanted to sit down in the first place.

### Day 18: January 30. Tuesday

**Today's Prgress**: IF you can call it progress, I went through another 3 units today covering Global and Local Scopes. Doesn't make much sense...or at least how the lesson was drawn up and laid out in the code screen. Registered a couple of domains davidqpyle .net and .me. I updated the .me site with my Portfolio Project, overhauled the footer icons in GIMP, and re-wrote my About Me section. Added my Musical Portfolio page to the 'Portfolio' section.

**Thoughts**: I have to get my head around these Scopes.

### Day 19: January 31. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Only finished 2 units today as I need to back up and take another look at JavaScript fundamentals.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 20: February 1. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2.5 hours watching multiple YouTube tutorials on JavaScript. I still want to spend another day or two going over additional tutorials before going back to the freeCodeCamp Development course. I want to fully understand.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes you cannot just start running because you decided to run. Sometimes, you have to warm up and sometimes you may have a bum ankle. But put in the work and time and soon enough you'll be running far ahead.

### Day 21: February 2. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched entire playlist of JavaScript Tutorials from @bucky_roberts on YouTube. Best parts were episodes 25 through 30 on Objects and the "this" item. 40 videos in all. Some outdted information was included such as 'new Array' instead of just omitting the 'new' altogether. There were a few others that I cannot recall atm.

**Thoughts**: Getting a little better grasp on JavaScript

### Day 22: February 3. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started off the day with JavaScript documentation and W3School. Learning more and more about Arrays Methods Objects Elements and installed Atom Editor on my notebook.

**Thoughts**: Chip away, chip away.

### Day 23: February 4. SuperBowl Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Spent most of the time today still going over MDN and W3School documentation and examples.

**Thoughts**: I don't want to see the Patriots or the Eagles win a SuperBowl today!

### OFF Day: February 5. Monday

**Thoughts**: Missed today's #100DaysOfCode due to being under the weather (SuperBowl), but like the rules state, I got right back on it!

### Day 24: February 6. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through another 23 units on the 'Front End Development' Certification course. The hours of tutorials I watched and read over the last week on Javascript seemed to have really paid off! Updated GitHub daily log since the last entry was Feb 1.

**Thoughts**: I was overthinking the 'Stand In Line' challenge and essentially had the correct answer dozens of times over and over, but the wording of the challenge appears to be incorrect as well. The forum had many people saying the same thing about this challenge.

### Day 25: February 7. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through another couple units on the 'Front End Dev' Certification course. Worked more on my portfolio site and that led me digging deeper into background images opacity and rgba CSS documentation and examples. Applied new background to site.

**Thoughts**: I should go back and review HTML and go further into CSS Grid

### Day 26: February 8. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Studied more JavaScript, mainly about passing data to functions and also increments and decrements. Trying to learn enough to work out Card Counting challenge on the Front End Dev course. Played around with the CSS on my portfolio site and learned more about â€˜radiusâ€™. Changed all my body divs to radius (rounded edges)

**Thoughts**: Need more training on JavaScript. I actually need training and a project to build so I can see real world examples on how it works in life.

### Day 27: February 9. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started a @udemy JavaScript Essential Mini-Course 2018 and watched a handful of videos. Pretty good free primer on the essentials I have learned so far. 

**Thoughts**: Every tutor or video teaches in such dramatically different ways. Maybe that is what I need to strive for....finding that one instructor that teaches me with a connection. That is a new goal, to find tht instructor!

### Day 28: February 10. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the udemy JavaScript Essentials 2018 mini-course. Updated daily log for the past few days. Found another course to tak, but this time with a hands on project.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I feel like I cannot learn all the things I am going to need to know to become a fully functional developer. Just so much information and knowledge to gain...and remember!
